# ✈ SkyLink Flight Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

SkyLink Flight Management System is a **Java-based desktop application** developed using **Swing GUI** and **Data Structures (Linked Lists)**.
It allows users to manage flights and passengers efficiently with a clean, user-friendly interface.

This project is designed for **academic learning**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **DSA logic**.

## 🎯 Features

* ➕ Add new flights
* 👤 Register passengers to specific flights
* 📋 View all flight schedules
* 🔍 Search flights by flight number
* 🔢 Sort flights alphabetically
* 💾 Save & load flight data using file handling
* 🖥 Interactive GUI using Java Swing

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* **Object-Oriented Programming**

  * Encapsulation
  * Abstraction
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
* **Data Structures**

  * Singly Linked List (Passengers)
  * Doubly Linked List (Flights)
* **Java Swing** (GUI)
* **File Handling**
* **Exception Handling**

├── Main.java           → GUI & user interaction
├── Airline.java        → Manages flight linked list
├── Flight.java         → Flight & passenger logic
├── Passenger.java     → Passenger node
├── FileManager.java   → Save & load data
├── flights.txt        → Stored flight data
└── README.md
```

## 🔧 How It Works

* Flights are stored using a **doubly linked list**
* Each flight contains a **singly linked list of passengers**
* GUI buttons trigger actions like add, search, sort, and save
* Data is persisted using text file storage

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Java (JDK 8+)
* Java Swing
* IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans
* Linked List (DSA)

---

## 👨‍🎓 Academic Purpose

This project was created for:

* Understanding **DSA traversal & logic**
* Practicing **Java Swing GUI**
* Demonstrating **OOP principles**
* Viva & semester project evaluation
